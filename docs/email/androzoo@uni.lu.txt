Dear Androzoo:

I am a faculty of iSE Laboratory in NanJing University. Our team are conducting a study on Android malware detection. Recently,we have read your paper which name is "Asking for (and about) permissions used by Android apps", and we would appreciate it if you provide access to the database(AndroZoo). Of course, your efforts will be included in the meta-analysis manuscript. This dataset is very important for our research. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you very much.

Best,
Sincerely,

FANG Chun-Rong
