Dear Drebin:

My name is FANG Chun-Rong. I am a faculty of iSE Laboratory at NanJing University, China (¸öÈËÖ÷Ò³).We are conducting a study on Android malware detection. I would appreciate it if you provide me the Drebin dataset. Of course, your papers (Drebin:Efficient and Explainable Detection of Android Malware in Your Pocket & MobileSandbox: Looking Deeper into Android Applications)  will be included in the meta-analysis manuscript. This dataset is very important for our research. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you very much.

Best,
Sincerely,

FANG Chun-Rong
